## Description
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/animoosignin.png">
For the Meteor hackathon, our team decided to tackle on the problem of depression and social anxiety among students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Because of the pandemic, school went online and started teaching classes virtually instead of in person. Many restaurants and social venues were closed as well as shops and public places. Social gatherings were banned, and at one point, there was a curfew set and people were forced to stay in home for the entire day. This has led to a spike in depression because humans strive on social interaction. Without it, they would feel isolated from the world. To tackle this, we created an app that could connect with people who have similiar hobbies.

During the pandemic, watching shows has increased dramatically. We wanted to take advantage of that and create a social media app that revolved around watching shows and movies. People can connect with their friends and keep track of eachother's favorite shows. This makes is easier to discuess the latest show that they watched and keep track of what everyone else is watching. 
On our application, we also created a user profile page where people can see a biography of yourself, your username, and a profile picture. We wanted to create a friend system and also a feed that people could leave comments but we couldn't get it to work with the restricted time that we had. Our anime list also lists down over 100 shows that a user can scroll through and like. The like button will then all that particular anime to their favorites collection.
