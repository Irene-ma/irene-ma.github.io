## Description
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/covidsightHome.png">

For ICS491, our team deicded to create a covid health tracking web application that logs in the user's health symptoms and keeps a record of all their check ins. With the wide pandemic of Covid-19, it is important for people to keep track of their symptoms to make sure the virus doesn't spread to more people. For our web application, users are able to create an account which takes them to the homepage of our application. The homepage has several options; there is a check in option for the users to log their health status for the day and also another option to upload their vaccination information as well as a picture of their vaccination card. This makes it easier for them to show establishments that require a vaccination card to enter their premises. Upon successful submission of the check in or vaccination record, the border in the homepage will update to green, telling the user that they are good to go. 

## Learning Experience

<img class="ui medium left floated rounded image" src="/images/firstplace.png">
Participating in this year’s HACC was very stressful but at the same time it was rewarding and interesting to see what projects and ideas the other team had in mind and how they brought that to life. It proved difficult to my team because we were on a time crunch and only had a limited number of weeks to get our project going. HACC’s deadline was much sooner than the deadline for the 314 final project so our team had to meet up twice as much to get everything done. At first we were skeptical about finishing the project on time because there were a lot of features that we had to implement and polish. Incorporating Google's API into our project was the hardest part because we had to fully understand how the API worked and somehow intertwine the code to fit with our code. With a little bit of help from Branden and Dr. Johnson, we were able to successfully get our code running and ended up placing first place for HACC! I am forever grateful for the hard work that our team put into and the countless hours that we spent on it. I wouldn’t have asked for a better team!
